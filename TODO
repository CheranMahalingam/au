    -e  --encode (output as encoded value rather than json)

  - encode string lengths as small ints
  - encode small int values as small ints
  - combine small-int and varint encoding? burns another bit in the marker (or at least one value)
  - encode 7 or 8-byte ints as fixed-width 8-byte ints
  - emit empty dict-add record periodically to keep backrefs from getting too big? (nice to have some stats on those)
