    -e  --encode (output as encoded value rather than json)

  - combine small-int and varint encoding? burns another bit in the marker (or at least one value)
  - add checks to emit empty dict-add record if backref approaches max?

  - the json parser in the encoder chokes on nan rather than NaN, but there isn't any kind of error. why?
  - teach grep about timestamps!
